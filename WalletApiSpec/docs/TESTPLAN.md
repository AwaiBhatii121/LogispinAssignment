# Test Plan: Wallet API

This document outlines the test plan for the Wallet API, focusing on transaction processing and related functionalities. The test suite is designed with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing externalized configurations, test data, and custom commands to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## 1. Test Automation Setup

The test framework is structured to be modular and maintainable:

*   **Configuration (`cypress.config.js`):** Centralizes environment-specific settings and base URLs.
*   **Test Data (`cypress/fixtures/wallet.json`):** Externalizes test data, allowing for easy updates without code changes.
*   **Custom Commands (`cypress/support/commands.js`):** Encapsulates repetitive API request logic into reusable commands (e.g., `cy.sendRequest`).
*   **API Endpoints (`cypress/support/constants.js`):** Defines all API endpoints in a single location for easy management.
*   **Test Helpers (`cypress/support/test-helpers.js`):** Provides utility functions for tasks like data generation and validation.

## 2. Implemented Test Cases

The following test cases have been implemented, covering a wide range of API functionalities.

### High Priority

*   **TC01: Process Successful Credit Transaction**
    *   **Description:** Validates that the API can successfully process a standard credit transaction. It asserts that the response has the correct structure, a valid transaction ID, and a status indicating completion.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC02: Process Successful Debit Transaction**
    *   **Description:** Ensures that a debit transaction is processed correctly when the wallet has sufficient funds. This test involves an initial credit to ensure a positive balance before the debit is attempted.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC03: Handle Pending Transaction Completion**
    *   **Description:** Verifies the system's ability to handle asynchronous transactions. It initiates a transaction that returns a 'pending' status and polls the API until the transaction is completed.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC06: Wallet Balance Consistency**
    *   **Description:** Checks that the wallet balance is updated correctly and remains consistent after a series of credit and debit transactions.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

### Medium Priority

*   **TC04: Multi-Currency Transaction Processing**
    *   **Description:** Tests the API's capability to handle transactions in different currencies, ensuring that separate currency clips are created and managed correctly within the wallet.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC05: Transaction Input Validation**
    *   **Description:** Verifies that the API correctly rejects transactions with invalid or malformed data, such as missing fields, zero, or negative amounts, returning appropriate error responses.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC07: Transaction History Retrieval and Filtering**
    *   **Description:** Confirms that the transaction history for a wallet can be retrieved with pagination. It also tests the filtering of transactions by a specific date range.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC08: Error Handling for Non-existent Resources**
    *   **Description:** Ensures the API provides graceful error handling by returning a 404 Not Found status when requests are made for a non-existent wallet or transaction.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

## 3. Unimplemented Test Cases (Future Work)

### High Priority

*   **UTC01: Concurrent Transaction Processing**
    *   **Description:** Test the system's ability to handle multiple simultaneous transactions for the same wallet to check for race conditions and ensure data integrity.

*   **UTC02: Idempotency Check for Transactions**
    *   **Description:** Verify that submitting the same transaction multiple times using an idempotency key does not result in duplicate processing, ensuring each transaction is processed only once.

### Medium Priority

*   **UTC03: Insufficient Funds Handling**
    *   **Description:** Tests the API's response to a debit transaction that exceeds the current wallet balance, expecting a 'declined' outcome and ensuring the balance is not negatively affected.

*   **UTC04: Advanced Transaction Filtering and Sorting**
    *   **Description:** Enhance tests for listing transactions to cover all filtering options (e.g., by type, status) and sorting combinations (e.g., by date, amount).

### Low Priority

*   **UTC05: Security and Authorization Testing**
    *   **Description:** Perform tests to ensure that users can only access their own wallet and transaction data, and cannot perform actions on behalf of other users.
