# Test Plan: Wallet API

This document outlines the test plan for the Wallet API, focusing on transaction processing and related functionalities.

## 1. Implemented Test Cases

### High Priority

*   **TC01: Process Successful Credit Transaction**
    *   **Description:** Validates that the API can process a basic credit transaction and return the correct response structure.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC02: Process Successful Debit Transaction**
    *   **Description:** Ensures that a standard debit transaction is processed correctly, and the wallet balance is updated appropriately.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC03: Retrieve Transaction Details**
    *   **Description:** Verifies that the details of a specific transaction can be retrieved accurately using its unique ID.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

### Medium Priority

*   **TC04: Handle Insufficient Funds**
    *   **Description:** Tests the API's response to a debit transaction that exceeds the current wallet balance, expecting a 'declined' outcome.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

*   **TC05: List All Transactions for a Wallet**
    *   **Description:** Checks if all transactions for a given wallet can be listed, with support for pagination and filtering.
    *   **File:** `cypress/api/wallet.spec.js`

## 2. Unimplemented Test Cases (Future Work)

### High Priority

*   **UTC01: Concurrent Transaction Processing**
    *   **Description:** Test the system's ability to handle multiple simultaneous transactions for the same wallet to check for race conditions.

*   **UTC02: Idempotency Check**
    *   **Description:** Verify that submitting the same transaction multiple times does not result in duplicate processing, using an idempotency key.

### Medium Priority

*   **UTC03: Invalid Input Validation**
    *   **Description:** Test the API's robustness by sending requests with malformed or invalid data (e.g., negative amounts, invalid currency codes).

*   **UTC04: Transaction Filtering and Sorting**
    *   **Description:** Enhance tests for listing transactions to cover all filtering options (by date, type, status) and sorting.

### Low Priority

*   **UTC05: Multi-Currency Transactions**
    *   **Description:** If applicable, test transactions involving currency conversion, ensuring correct exchange rates and calculations.
